Blood in the sink, I can barely think
Spent a rack last night on my fucking drinks
All I see is money, all I see is red
You can take what you want 'cause I'm almost dead (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You can tell that I'm lost, I should go to bed
Say I'm fine but I'm not, you should see my head
No, I never forgot all the things you said (Yeah)
Make it by 'cause I'm on all these fucking meds
